            <span class="subtitle">The abrupt transition to remote learning caused by the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the issue that Motivation sets out to solve: a severe lack of motivation among those who learn remotely</span>. Motivation aims to be a tool that students can use to stay motivated, cultivate productive habits, and communicate with other students. While there are many popular productivity applications on the market right now, there is no single tool that would allow users to track their habits, communicate with others, and stay focused all in one app.
Motivation is a mobile app that students can access by downloading through the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store. Students, especially those having to learn remotely, are the key audience that Motivation aims to provide services for. 
The creators of Motivation are two seniors from the Journalism school, Yichen Yu and JoJo Yang, who have personally struggled with a lack of motivation due to remote learning. 
The core features of the Motivation app are a habit tracker, a calendar, a chat page, and a user center. Students will be able to create habits that they want to keep track of and view their progress in the calendar. They will also be able to create group chats with their classmates to organize study sessions and ask questions. The user center allows students to access their friends and achievements, which is meant to gamify their productivity journey and incentivize good habits. Because the app is designed specifically for college students, these pages mimic a healthy studying environment and provide assistance with staying on track academically. 
Motivation will be used by college students to connect with others that attend the same universities. It will enable college students to collaborate and study together. Motivation will improve the college experience and allow students to improve both academically and mentally, especially for those learning remotely.
